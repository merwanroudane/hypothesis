# hypothesis
 this application demonstrates key concepts in hypothesis testing for regression analysis through interactive visualizations and simulations. The app covers topics such as t-tests, F-tests, p-value interpretation, and multiple hypothesis testing in regression.

Features
Interactive t-test Visualizations:
Explore the t-distribution, view rejection regions for two-tailed, right-tailed, and left-tailed tests, and calculate p-values for given test statistics.

F-test Analysis:
Visualize the F-distribution, determine critical values and rejection regions, and perform overall model and group coefficient tests.

Interactive Regression Example:
Fit a regression model on sample or user-uploaded data, and see how test statistics, RÂ², and confidence intervals are affected.

Multiple Hypothesis Testing:
Evaluate individual coefficient significance as well as joint tests for groups of predictors, with visual explanations and decision criteria.

Distribution Properties:
Investigate how degrees of freedom affect the shape of t- and F-distributions and compare one-tailed versus two-tailed tests.
